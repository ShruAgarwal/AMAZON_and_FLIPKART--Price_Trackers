## ðŸ’¡ Idea behind building two trackers --

*Idea is simple!* ðŸ˜‰. 
- Both of the trackers helps to monitor the product prices that keep fluctuating most of the time!
- Also, I have attached a ``` .csv ``` file which contains the list of products along with their Amazon & Flipkart links in it. This file acts as a input for both of the trackers.

As an example, I have attached some of my favourite books ðŸ“š along with their shopping links in the ``` Books_data.csv ``` file.



### Here's how it works : ðŸ‘‡

After running all the code blocks --
1. I get an input box to enter the Name of the Product
2. I've entered one of my Book ðŸ“• picks from the ```Books_data.csv``` file
3. Info fetched from AMAZON and FLIPKART about the product (Book) is shown up!
