## ðŸ’¡ Idea behind building two trackers --

*Idea is simple!* ðŸ˜‰. 
- Both of the trackers helps to monitor the product prices that keep fluctuating most of the time!
- Also, I have attached a ``` .csv ``` file which contains the list of products along with their Amazon & Flipkart links in it. This file acts as a input for both of the trackers.

As an example, I have attached some of my favourite books ðŸ“š along with their shopping links in the ``` Books_data.csv ``` file.

### Here's how it works : ðŸ‘‡

1. After running all the code blocks, I get an input box to enter the Name of the Product (Book name is an example here) --

2. You can enter your favorite Product name from the ```.csv``` file (One of my Book picks here! ðŸ“•)

3. Info about the Product from AMAZON & FLIPKART comes up!
